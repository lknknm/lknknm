### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a former Architect (the one who makes buildings), based on SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil.

- ðŸŒ± I am currently studying at Harvard's CS50x course + engaging in some personal projects using Python.
- ðŸ‘¯ Looking forward to collaborate on Open Source projects such as Blender3D, VSCode, Signal and much more.
- âš¡ I also happen to be a musician, so share some love on my SoundCloud and Instagram!

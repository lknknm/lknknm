### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a former Architect (the one who makes buildings), based on SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil.

- ðŸŒ± I am currently studying at Harvard's CS50x course + engaging in some personal Blender3D projects using Python.
- ðŸ‘¯ Looking forward to collaborate on Open Source projects such as Blender3D, VSCode, Signal Messenger and much more.
- ðŸ’¬ If you ask me about anything we will nerd over tech, art, music, life (you name it) all day long.
- âš¡ I also happen to be a musician, so share some love on my SoundCloud and Instagram!

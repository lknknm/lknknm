### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a former Architect (the one who makes buildings), based on SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil.
Devoted to solving highly complex problems and developing efficient tools. 

Bachelor of Architecture and Urban Studies. Seeking to build meaningful software to solve the problems I encountered under many years of experience in the architecture field.
- 5+ years of experience in architecture and urban studies.
- 1 year of experience in programming and software development. I specially have some love for C/C++ and C#.
- Deep passion and drive for music production, being a self-promoted independent artist (You can also check my work below!).
